  \centering \textbf{$b$-jet measurements with CMS}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Jets resulting from a framgenting $b$-quark are interesting objects because they are good tests many theories
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Heavy flavor QCD
    \item B-meson physics
    \end{itemize}
  \item Many methods have been deployed to identify $b$-jets
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Impact Parameter (IP) Significance
      \begin{itemize}
      \item IP is the distance between the primary vertex and the point of closest approach of a track
      \item $b$-jets tend to have wider IP distributions
      \end{itemize}
    \item Secondary Vertex Reconstruction
    \item $b$-jets tend to have secondary vertices due to in-flight decays
    \item Jet Probability
    \item Soft Lepton Tagging
    \item Deep Learning Techniques
    \end{itemize}
